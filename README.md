## Chapter 2 Basics elements of a C++ 
- A C++ is a collection of functions.
- Every C++ program has a function called main.
- A single line comment start with // anywhere in the line.
- Multiline comments are enclosed between /* and */.
- Reserved words can't be used as identifier in a program.
- All reserved words consist of lowercase letters.
- Identifiers are name of things.
- An identifier consist of letters, digits, and underscores and must begin with letter or underscore. 
- C++ data types are: simle, structured, and pointers. 
- Simple has three categories: integral, floating-point, and enumeration. 
- Integral data types are classified into 9 categories: char, short, int, long, bool, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int and unsigned long.
- bool has two types: true and false. 
- C++ provides 3 data types to manipulate decimale numbers: float, double, and long double. 
- In C++ , >> is called stream extraction operator.
- Input from the standrd input device is accomlished by using cin and >>.
- In C++ , << is called stream insertion operator.
- Output fof the program is accomlished by using cout and <<.
- The manipulator endlpositions the insertion point at the begning of the next lines on an output device.
- The \ charchter is called the escape charchter.
- The sequence \n is called the newline escape charchter. 
- All preprocessor commands start with the symbol #.
- The # include<iostream> instruct the preprocessor to include the header file iostream in the program.
- To use the cin and cout , you must include using namespace std.
- All C++ statements ends with a semicolon.
- The extenstion is .cpp.
